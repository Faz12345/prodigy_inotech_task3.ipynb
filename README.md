Task Description
The task was part of my virtual internship at Prodigy Infotech. The main objective was to build a machine learning model (Decision Tree) that can classify customers based on whether they are likely to purchase a product or service. This model helps in understanding which customer segments are most likely to convert, aiding marketing and sales efforts.

Key Steps Performed
Data Preprocessing:
#Handled missing values.

Categorical variables were encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding. Scaled and normalized the data for better model performance. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed the distribution of variables (age, job type, marital status, etc.).
Examined relationships between key variables and purchase decisions. Visualized correlations between features using heatmaps. Building the Decision Tree Classifier:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Trained a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchases. Optimized the model by tuning hyperparameters like maximum depth, splitting criteria, etc. Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Generated a confusion matrix to visualize performance. Feature Importance:

Analyzed which features contributed the most to the model's decision-making process.

Libraries Used
pandas for data manipulation matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization scikit-learn for machine learning model building and evaluation NumPy for numerical operations

Dataset
The dataset used is similar to the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing features like:

Age: Age of the customer. Job: Type of job. Marital Status: Whether the customer is married, single, or divorced. Education: Level of education. Balance: Bank balance of the customer. Campaign: Number of contacts performed during this campaign. Previous Outcome: Outcome of the previous marketing campaign. Purchase: Whether the customer purchased the product (target variable).

Results
The decision tree classifier performed well in predicting customer purchases, with a focus on improving accuracy and interpretability through feature importance analysis.
